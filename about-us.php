      <h1>About Us</h1>
    <br />
      <p>Food2U is a student-run fast food delivery service that caters to students on and near the UCI campus.
        As college students ourselves, we know that there comes a time for every student where they
        have a lot of work to do and not enough time. We came up with the idea for a delivery service
        specifically for UCI students so we could cater to these busy students, and the lazy ones as
        well.
        <br><br>It is our mission to provide busy college students with a fast and affordable way to have
        food delivered to them so they can continue doing whatever activities they choose to fill
        their day with.
